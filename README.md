# lambda-minimal-theme
A simple zsh prompt theme based on lambda. Supports `git` and `virtualenv`.

## Installation
> This theme only supports [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). To get support in other zsh frameworks, oh-my-zsh-equivalent `git_prompt_info` and `virtualenv_prompt_info` are needed.

The process is quite straightforward. Just download the file `lambda-minimal.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` directory from the repo.

```
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sohnryang/lambda-minimal-theme/master/lambda-minimal.zsh-theme' -o $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/lambda-minimal.zsh-theme
```
